 * than 桜羽[さくらば]エマ. Names are also the highest-frequency tokens in a
 * visual novel, so getting them wrong is wrong constantly.
 *
 * Readings are curated rather than looked up. JMnedict does contain these
 * surnames, but offers four readings for 桜羽 and eight for 橘, and the one it
 * marks for 桜羽 is さくらは while the game's own romanisation is Sakuraba. A
 * dictionary that confidently supplies a wrong reading is worse here than no
 * dictionary at all, and the cast is small enough to fill in by hand once.
 *
 * The names themselves are discovered automatically from the speaker thread, so
 * only the reading ever needs a human.
